homework 2: merging data files
==============================

requirement
----------

There are two data files:

- hot water: hourly data on the hot water *temperature*
- electricity: daily data on the *energy* produced by a photovoltaic system.

The goal of the exercise is to produce a script that could be used monthly
to merge the 2 data files of the month, where the energy value from each day
is matched to the temperature value at the nearest time.

Write a Python script that takes 2 file names as arguments, and creates
an output with the merged data, in csv format (comma-separated variables).


files in hw2
----------

- readme.md
- data file: energy.csv
- data file: waterTemperature
- python script
- output file: merge_script.py


execution instructions:
----------

Run " python merge_script.py" in the folder containing two data files
