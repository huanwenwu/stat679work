This directory contains my solutions of homework1, including two scripts named "normalizeFileNames.sh" and "summarizeSNaQres.sh", and two folders "log" and "out". Besides, there is also a csv file "hw1.csv", and it is the output of the exercises. 

Open the stat679work/hw1 directory, then command: bash summarizeSNaQres.sh, and then the script will be executed.
